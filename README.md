Rust style `Result` type for Scala

## Context

In the opinion of the author `Either` and `Try` are inferior to the semantic benefits of a dedicated `Result` type.
Unfortunately, prior discussions regarding the addition of a `Result` type to the standard library have not borne fruit. 
[Pre-SIP: Rust-like "Result" Proposal](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/pre-sip-proposal-of-introducing-a-rust-like-type-result/3497)
So we'll have to go a with an unofficial solution.
