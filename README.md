#  Scala Result

Rust style `Result` type for Scala

## Context

In the opinion of the author `Either` and `Try` are inferior to the semantic benefits of a dedicated `Result` type.
Unfortunately, prior discussions regarding the addition of a `Result` type to the standard library have not borne fruit. 
[Pre-SIP: Rust-like "Result" Proposal](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/pre-sip-proposal-of-introducing-a-rust-like-type-result/3497)
So we'll have to go a with an unofficial solution.

## Documentation

* [API Scala 2.13](https://jsbrucker.github.io/scala-result/scala-2.13/api/result/index.html)
* [API Scala 2.12](https://jsbrucker.github.io/scala-result/scala-2.12/api/result/index.html)

ScalaDocs can be generated by running `$ sbt doc` and viewed by opening `./target/scala-2.13/api/result/Result.html`.

## Packages

Pre-packaged jars are not yet available, but there are plans to make them available in the coming weeks ETA Dec-2022.
